Automated Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews :

1.Overview
This project aims to classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to help restaurant owners understand customer sentiment and improve services.

2. Importance and Relevance
Sentiment analysis helps in understanding public opinion and making data-driven decisions. This project uses advanced NLP techniques, including transformers, to achieve high accuracy in sentiment classification.

3. NLP Tasks and Challenges
Key NLP tasks include text preprocessing, tokenization, feature extraction, and model building using transformer-based architectures like BERT. Challenges involve handling imbalanced data, preprocessing text data, and fine-tuning models.

4. Problem Statement
The project addresses the binary classification problem of determining whether restaurant reviews are positive or negative. This helps restaurant owners understand customer satisfaction.

5. Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Remove duplicates, tokenize text, handle missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze data distribution, check for class imbalances.
Feature Engineering: Use TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), and transformers like BERT.
Model Building: Split data, choose a transformer model, fine-tune, and validate performance.
Model Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Deployment: Save and deploy the model to classify new reviews.

6. Data
Data Sources: "Restaurant Reviews" dataset from Kaggle.
Dataset Description: Contains 1000 reviews with 'Review' and 'Liked' columns.

7. Implementation Details
Data Preprocessing: Clean and tokenize data.
EDA: Visualize and analyze data.
Feature Engineering: Convert text to numerical format.
Model Building: Train and validate transformer-based models.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using relevant metrics.
Model Deployment: Deploy the model to classify new reviews.

8. Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance will be measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure both positive and negative sentiments are accurately classified.

9. Expected Results
The project aims to develop a high-performing sentiment analysis model capable of accurately classifying restaurant reviews. For example:

Input: "This restaurant exceeded all of my expectations! The food was outstanding, the service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was delightful. I can't wait to come back!"
Prediction: 1 (Positive)
These results will demonstrate the effectiveness of using transformers for sentiment analysis and provide valuable insights for restaurant owners.
